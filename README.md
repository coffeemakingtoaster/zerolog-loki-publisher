# Zerolog loki publisher

Simple zerolog hook for pushing log messages to loki directly.
This is WIP, so maybe do not use it for production environments :)   

Install:

```sh
go get -u github.com/coffeemakingtoaster/zerolog-loki-publisher
```

## Usage

See [example](./example/main.go) (make sure to also start the docker compose)
